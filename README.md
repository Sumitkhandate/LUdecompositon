# LU_decomposition
In numerical analysis and linear algebra, lower–upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination.


The basic principle here is – “A square matrix [A] can be written as the product of a lower triangular matrix [L] and an upper triangular matrix [U], one of them being unit triangular, if all the principal minors of [A] are non-singular.
